# Project-4: Coaches Corner

## Project Information
This project was apart of my Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly. The objective was to create a full-stack MERN application that met the following requirements:

 1. A working full-stack, single-page application hosted on Heroku.
 2. Incorporate the technologies of the MERN-stack:MongoDB/Mongoose, Express, React, Node
 3. Have a well-styled interactive front-end.
 4. Communicates with the Express backend via AJAX.
 5. Implement token-based authentication. Including the ability of a user to sign-up, log in & log out.
 6. Implement authorization by restricting CUD data functionality to authenticated users. Also, navigation should respond to the login status of the user.
 7. Have a well-scoped feature-set.

## Hurdles
 - The first hurdle I faced was just understanding the flow within React. 
 
 
 - The other hurdle I faced was getting my details page to show. 
 
## Future Features
 - Improved CSS
 - The ability to add drills on the practice plan detail page
